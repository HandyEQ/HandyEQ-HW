WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal PhyRxEr connected to top level port PhyRxEr has been
   removed.

Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:2912 - The LUT-1 inverter
   "eth0.e1/m100.u0/ethc0/r_mdioclk_INV_1032_o1_INV_0" failed to join the
   "OLOGICE2" comp matched to output buffer
   "ethpads.emdc_pad/xcv.x0/ttl0.slow0.op".  This may result in suboptimal
   timing.  The LUT-1 inverter eth0.e1/m100.u0/ethc0/r_mdioclk_INV_1032_o1_INV_0
   drives multiple loads.
WARNING:Pack:1186 - One or more I/O components have conflicting property values.
    For each occurrence, the system will use the property value attached to the
   pad.  Otherwise, the system will use the first property value read.  To view
   each occurrence, create a detailed map report (run map using the -detail
   option).

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
